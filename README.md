# Edumate AI Agent

## About the Project

Edumate AI Agent is a smart academic assistant created to make learning support easier and more accessible for students and educators. The idea behind this project was simple — instead of searching through multiple resources or waiting for help, users can interact with an AI agent that understands their questions and gives clear, structured guidance in real time.

Whether it’s explaining concepts, helping with assignments, or guiding students through projects, Edumate acts like a virtual mentor that is always available.
